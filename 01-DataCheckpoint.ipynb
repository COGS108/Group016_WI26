Each row represents one student, identified by a unique Student ID ranging from 1001 to 3392. The dataset includes approximately 2,392 student observations and 15 variables. \n",

    "Dataset Limitations & Concerns\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Age Range (15–18 years): The dataset appears to represent high school students rather than higher-education students. While our research question refers to higher education, this dataset still allows us to explore relationships between habits and academic performance in a structured academic environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Self-Reported Behavior: Study time and absences may be self-reported and subject to reporting bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Categorical Encoding: Several variables are numerically coded but represent categories. These must be treated as categorical variables during modeling to avoid incorrect assumptions of linear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Derived Variable (GradeClass): Because GradeClass is calculated directly from GPA, including both in modeling would introduce leakage. Therefore, GPA will be used as the regression outcome."
