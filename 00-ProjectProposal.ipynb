    "How do student demographics, study habits, and non-academic behaviors relate to academic performance (e.g., semester grades) in a recent higher-education context? Specifically, which factors (attendance, study preparation time, gaming habits, family income, etc.) are most predictive of a student’s final GPA, and can we build a predictive model that outperforms a simple baseline? This is a regression problem where the outcome variable will be GPA or equivalent grade metrics, and predictors include socio-economic and behavior attributes. The research will include controlling for confounders such as department/major and gender. It will explore both statistical significance of variables and predictive power via machine learning models.\n",

    "Academic performance in higher education is influenced by a mix of student habits, demographic characteristics, and lifestyle behaviors. We define academic success using quantitative measures such as GPA or final course grades. GPA is not only important within the academic environment but is also connected to future opportunities such as graduate school admissions and job offers. Employer surveys indicate that GPA has historically been used as an initial screening tool in entry-level hiring, meaning that stronger academic performance can increase access to early career opportunities, even as some employers shift toward skills-based hiring practices ([NACE, 2023](https://www.naceweb.org/talent-acquisition/trends-and-predictions/nearly-two-thirds-of-employers-use-skills-based-hiring-practices-for-new-entry-level-hires?utm_source=chatgpt.com)). Understanding what influences academic performance may therefore help students improve both academic and post-graduate outcomes. Prior research suggests that both academic behaviors and non-academic factors, such as sleep patterns or leisure activities, play roles in shaping student outcomes, though the relative strength of these influences varies by context and population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Studies have consistently shown that class attendance and engagement are strongly associated with higher academic achievement. Research across institutions has found that increased attendance reduces the likelihood of poor academic outcomes such as failing or withdrawing from courses, suggesting that attendance is a strong predictor of academic success ([Credé et al., 2010](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1248452.pdf)). In contrast, excessive video game use and screen time have been linked to lower GPA. Research examining video game usage among college students finds that higher levels of gaming are associated with reduced study time and weaker time management skills, which can negatively affect academic performance ([Anand, 2017](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303226124_The_impact_of_video_games_on_student_GPA_study_habits_and_time_management_skills_What's_the_big_deal)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Demographic and socioeconomic factors have also been associated with variation in academic performance. Research on socioeconomic status suggests that indicators such as family income and parental education are correlated with GPA, likely because these factors influence access to educational resources, academic support systems, and the amount of time students can devote to studying. These findings highlight the importance of considering both individual behaviors and background characteristics when modeling academic performance, as academic outcomes are shaped by structural as well as personal factors ([Credé et al., 2010](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1248452.pdf)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-academic lifestyle factors, particularly sleep and time management, have also been identified as important predictors of academic performance. Studies of college students show that sleep duration and sleep quality are positively associated with GPA, while chronic sleep deprivation is linked to lower academic performance and increased academic stress ([Short et al., 2023](https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(23)00373-7/fulltext)). Additionally, research comparing working and non-working students suggests that employment responsibilities can indirectly affect academic outcomes by reducing time available for sleep and study. Together, these findings suggest that lifestyle constraints outside the classroom can meaningfully influence academic success and should be accounted for in analyses of student performance.\n"

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "We hypothesize that students with better academic habits, especially higher attendance and more consistent study time, will have higher grades. We also predict that non-academic behaviors that take time away from schoolwork, for example gaming time and alcohol use, will be negatively associated with GPA. For demographic/socioeconomic factors, we expect them to explain less variation in GPA than academic behaviors. Overall, we expect that a predictive model using these habit variables will show a simple baseline by meaningfully reducing prediction error and that attendance and study time will appear as the most important predictors across models. \n"
